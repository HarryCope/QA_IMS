# Project Title

This project connects to a database allowing the input of customers, items and the orders combining both customers and their orders. It connects to a MySQL database that it will create itself calles "ims".

## Getting Started

In order to connect to your data base you will need to edit the db.properties file. Change the base URL to match that of your SQl server whether local or otherwise and for the regular url make sure to add "/ims" to the end in order to connect to this database specifically. The username and password need to match that of your detatils for MySQL.
